"""
Implementation of simple random sampling algorithms.

Simple random sampling is an unweighted sampling scheme of :math:`k` units from a population of :math:`n` units such
that all :math:`k`-order inclusion probabilities are equal. As a result, all samples of size :math:`k` are equiprobable.
Although other algorithms might also possess this property, the algorithms comprising this package typically don't have
any other special interface or performance characteristics.
