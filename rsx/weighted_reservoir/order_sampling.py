"""
Implementation of order sampling as defined in [1]_ (Section 2.8).

According to order sampling, each unit of the population is assigned a key based on its weight and the items with the
largest key are selected as the sample. The implementation is based on a priority queue algorithm, in order to abide by
the specification of the reservoir sampling interface, within the abstract class :class:`OrderSampling`.
