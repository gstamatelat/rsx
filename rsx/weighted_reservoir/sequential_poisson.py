r"""
Implementation of the sequential Poisson order sampling algorithm by Ohlsson in [1]_.

This algorithm does not satisfy the ratio estimator property but is an approximation of it. The weights accepted by this
implementation are in the range :math:`(0, \infty)`. This is an implementation of :class:`OrderSampling
<rsx.weighted_reservoir.order_sampling.OrderSampling>` where the keys are equal to

.. math::

   \frac{w}{r}.

The default weight is :math:`1.0`.
